I am cat-12 and I am a second year computer science student. (Lol)
I’m currently learning various languages and not really sure how to progress or if I am making any. 

I feel as aimless as I did years ago...


I’m looking to collaborate on improving my mental health and self-worth lmao.

I have an interest in computer security and enjoy participating in CTFs and hackathons.

I enjoy reverse engineering. It feels productive.
